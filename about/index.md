## About

Prior to joining Visionist, Eric served as an active duty Naval Officer for more than 10 years with roles in Aviation, Administration, Education and Training. As a Naval Aviatior, he earned the callsign **Stewie** which he has fully embraced.

Eric holds an M.S. in Analytics from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. He also holds an MBA from the University of Mississippi and a B.S. in Computer Science from the United States Naval Academy.

Despite his better half’s wishes, he is hopelessly devoted to the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Newcastle United F.C. and to PC Gaming.  

As for the Stewie picture, you can blame that on the Navy: it's the callsign he earned as a helicopter pilot.
