**The Journey Begins**
===
Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. In the weeks and months ahead, I hope to contribute to this site on a regular basis as my journey in the Data Science community begins in a professional sense. From time to time I'll highlight new tools, technologies, or techniques that I come across in my day-to-day work that I find unique and interesting. I also hope to develop several personal projects relating to my interest in Newcastle United F.C., Nebraska Cornhusker football, and PC Gaming.

Watch this space for more and let's make the last half of 2017 one to remember!
